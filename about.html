            <p>Two soul sisters, one vision: to hold space for healing and transformation</p>

            <h2>How We Came Together</h2>
            <p>We are two soul sisters who found each other through our shared love of holding space for others. Each of us has walked our own path of healing, transformation, and self-discovery. Each of us carries unique gifts that, when woven together, create something powerful and whole.</p>
            <p>What began as individual practices in sound healing and shadow work naturally merged into something greater. We realized that true wellness isn't found in isolation but in integration. The body needs the breath. The nervous system needs the sound. The soul needs the shadow work. And all of it needs to be held in sacred, loving space.</p>
            <p>Based in Tullamore, in the heart of Ireland's Midlands, we create experiences that honor the whole person—body, mind, and soul. We also travel throughout Ireland, bringing our workshops to communities ready to deepen their relationship with themselves.</p>

                    <h3>Miya</h3>
                    <h4>Sound Healer & Facilitator</h4>
                    <p>Miya's journey into sound healing began with her own need for deep rest. In a world of constant noise and stimulation, she discovered the profound healing available in therapeutic sound and intentional vibration.</p>
                    <p>Through singing bowls, vocal toning, and other sound healing instruments, Miya creates sonic landscapes that guide participants into states of deep relaxation they often haven't experienced in years. The vibrations work on a cellular level, allowing the nervous system to finally rest and the body to remember its natural state of ease.</p>
                    <p>Her gifts lie not just in her technical skill, but in her ability to hold space with profound presence. She reads the energy of the room and responds intuitively, creating a unique journey for each group she guides.</p>

                <div class="facilitator">
                    <h3>Lydia</h3>
                    <h4>Shadow Work & Self-Acceptance Coach</h4>
                    <p>Lydia's path to shadow work began with her own journey of self-acceptance. After years of hiding parts of herself she deemed "unacceptable," she discovered that true wholeness comes not from perfection but from integration—embracing all parts of ourselves, even the ones we've kept hidden in shadow.</p>
                    <p>As a shadow work and self-acceptance coach, Lydia creates deeply compassionate space for exploring the inner landscape. She guides others to meet the parts of themselves they've rejected, judged, or pushed away, and to welcome those parts home with loving acceptance.</p>
                    <p>Her approach is gentle yet profound. She understands that shadow work isn't about forcing or fixing—it's about witnessing, accepting, and integrating. She holds space with such tenderness that participants feel safe to explore depths they've never dared to touch.</p>

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="philosophy-content">
                <p>We believe that whole body health is not just about what you eat or how much you exercise. True wellness requires nourishment of body, mind, and soul. It requires the courage to look within, the willingness to feel deeply, and the commitment to showing up for yourself again and again.</p>
                <p>We believe your relationship with yourself is your most important relationship. Everything else in your life flows from this foundation. When you come home to yourself, when you remember your wholeness, when you embrace all parts of who you are—that's when true healing happens.</p>
                <p>We believe in the power of holding space. In a world that constantly demands you do more, be more, achieve more, we create containers where you can simply be. Where you're welcomed exactly as you are. Where there's no pressure to perform or pretend or prove anything.</p>
                <p>We believe healing happens in community. While each person's journey is unique, there's profound medicine in coming together, in witnessing and being witnessed, in remembering we're not alone in our struggles or our seeking.</p>

                    <h3>For Connection</h3>
                    <p>We've both experienced the pain of disconnection—from ourselves, from our bodies, from our truth. We hold space so others can find their way back home.</p>

                <div class="offering">
                    <h3>For Healing</h3>
                    <p>We know the power of being held in sacred space during times of transformation. We create these containers because we wish we'd had them on our own journeys.</p>

                    <h3>For Wholeness</h3>
                    <p>We believe everyone deserves to feel whole. Not fixed or perfect, but integrated, accepted, and at peace with all parts of themselves.</p>

                <div class="offering">
                    <h3>For Love</h3>
                    <p>At the core of everything we do is love. Love for humanity, love for the healing process, and love for each person who trusts us to hold space for them.</p>
