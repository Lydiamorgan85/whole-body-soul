            <h2>Welcome Home to Yourself</h2>
            <p>We are Miya and Lydia—two soul sisters passionate about holding sacred space for healing and transformation. Based in Tullamore and journeying throughout Ireland's Midlands and beyond, we create experiences that honour the truth that whole body health extends far beyond nutrition and fitness.</p>
            <p>True wellness is the nourishment of body, mind, and soul. It's the courage to look within, the breath that connects us to presence, and the sound that vibrates healing through every cell. We believe your relationship with yourself is the foundation for everything else in your life.</p>

            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="philosophy-content">
                <p>Whole body health isn't found in a meal plan or a workout routine alone. It's discovered in the quiet moments of meditation, the tears released during shadow work, the expansion felt through conscious breath, and the vibrations that remind your cells they know how to heal.</p>
                <p>We hold space for the messy, beautiful process of coming home to yourself. Our workshops aren't about fixing you—because you're not broken. They're about remembering, reconnecting, and reclaiming the relationship with yourself that is your birthright.</p>
                <p>In a world that constantly pulls your attention outward, we invite you inward. To feel. To breathe. To sound. To see yourself fully and love what you find there.</p>
